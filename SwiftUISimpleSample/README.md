# SwiftUI Simple Sample

Written in SwiftUI, rudimentary sample that shows how to quickly and easily set up Price Checking with PPLE SDK.
The sample demonstrates how to:
1. Authenticate with ShelfView credentials,
2. Fetch the stores, product catalog and the config,
3. Add the `CaptureView` UI component,
4. Begin price checking.

The sample applies the most typical settings you would expect in the price checking flow, including:
* A rectangular viewfinder placed in the middle of the screen,
* A restriction of the active scanning area to part of the screen within that viewfinder,
* AR overlays floating on top of the barcode belonging to the price label that has been detected within the active scan area.
